\n","\n","It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010.\n","SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars wheras other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. \n","\n","\n","Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. \n","\n","This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.\n","\n","This dataset includes a record for each payload carried during a SpaceX mission into outer space.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ffe8c135-38dc-4e01-9956-5f5bc504f285","metadata":{},"source":["\n","\n","\n","\n","#### Click on the link below if you want to directly download the
