## Project Overview
In this project, we:
- **Collect Data**: Harness REST APIs and implement web scraping on Wikipedia to gather detailed information about Falcon 9 launches.
- **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use core Python libraries to explore, manipulate, clean, and visualize the data, gaining preliminary insights and preparing the dataset for deeper analysis.
- **Map Visualization**: Employ Folium to create illustrative maps that provide geographical insights into launch sites and trajectories.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Develop an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash, enabling users to visually interact with the data and uncover hidden patterns.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Construct predictive machine learning models to forecast landing outcomes. This involves rigorous feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation to ensure model accuracy and reliability.

This project offers a holistic analysis of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket launches, covering data collection, exploratory analysis, map visualization, an interactive dashboard, and predictive modeling.

## Data Sources
- **SpaceX REST API**: We utilize the official SpaceX API to fetch real-time data about rocket launches.
- **Wikipedia**: Data concerning historical launches is scraped from the List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches using BeautifulSoup4.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language used for data collection, manipulation, and analysis.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Used for creating static plots and visualizations.
- **Folium**: For generating interactive maps to visualize geographical data.
- **Plotly Dash**: For building the interactive web-based dashboard that displays analysis results.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For building and tuning machine learning models.
